## Manufacture, Repair, and Inspections of Inflatable Play Equipment

Essex Inflatables has been making and repairing bouncy castles and other inflatable equipment since 1994, and inspecting since 1997 under the HSE's "recommendations for best practice".

### Inspections

We became a PIPA Inspection Body in 2004 and now offer the HSE-endorsed PIPA Inspection Service, using the EU standard: **BS EN 14960** ([bsigroup.com](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/inflatable-play-equipment-safety-requirements-and-test-methods)), as well as annual inspections of inflatable play devices that are currently not within PIPA's remit.

### Repairs

We currently offer a full repair service for most inflatable play devices using the air cooled twin needle Sewing machine and the highest quality PVCs and thread.
